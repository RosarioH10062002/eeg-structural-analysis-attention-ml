# Structural Organization of EEG Features in Attention States

This repository contains the code developed for a research project on the structural analysis of EEG-derived spectral features and their relationship to attentional states.

The project focuses on understanding how inter-channel relationships and feature geometry emerge in high-dimensional EEG data, rather than on optimizing classification performance.

This work was conducted as part of an M1 research project (2025) under the supervision of **Dr. Axel Hutt** (INRIA / ICube).

## Research Focus

- High-dimensional structure of EEG spectral features  
- Fronto-parietal (Fpz–Pz) relationships in attention and inattention  
- Dimensionality reduction as a tool for structure discovery  
- Limits of classification-based evaluation in noisy neural data

## Methods (High-Level)

- Spectral features: delta, alpha, theta/beta ratio (TBR)
- Dimensionality reduction: PCA, ICA, UMAP, t-SNE
- Supervised learning: SVM, Extra Trees
- Unsupervised learning: K-Means, hierarchical clustering
- Correlation and regression analyses
